    <h1 class="type-display">About me</h1>

    <p>My main focus is on Vue 3, with solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>
      I enjoy creating interactive web and SVG animations with the help of JavaScript
      libraries like GSAP, AnimeJs and MotionOne.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some experience with backend development using NodeJs, Express and databases
      like MySQL, Postgres and Firebase.
    </p>
    <p>
      For project design I use Figma and for some projects Illustrator or Photoshop as
      well.
